<!--
-refactor edit form from FORM_TAG to FORM_FOR
-acces to @post instance var and pass that to form_for
-also remove path arg & method,
-form_for is smart enough to set that and know to utilize PUT dealing w/ pre-existing record
-|f|: iterator var used on new form obj to allow dynamic assign form field elements to each beer data attr
-no longer have to pass ed values manually
-passing attr as a :symbol, automatically tells form field what model attr to associate with

PUT vs PATCH
PUT: ability to update entires object
PATCH: simply updates elements that were changed
