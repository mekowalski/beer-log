<!-- this now is displaying name BUT...
 the link_to is supposed to take me to either `/beers/:id/companies/:id OR /companies/:id`
 instead the url is actually `http://localhost:3000/beers/Carver Brewing Company` so that's all wrong
 also think my error is present because i haven't gotten to nesting yet, not sure though -->
