I want to have a bunch of beer with information of each beer

Also want to CRUD with the beer
-Create (new) beer
-Read (index/show) beer
-Update (edit) beer (why would i update a beer though, thinking cap)
-Delete (destroy) beer

A Beer will belong to a Company and will belong to a BeerStyle
-so i possibly need a company and beerstyle attribute in the DB schema
eg: Colorado Kolsch will belong to Steamworks Brewing Co

A BeerStyle will have many beers
eg: stout will have Imperial Stout, Backside Stout, Draught Stout, etc

A Company will have many beers and will have many BeerStyles(don't want to worry about beerstyle yet)
eg: SteamWorks Brewing Co will have Colorado Kolsch, BackSide Stout, etc
*the company should only show the beers that you had at that company. say I've had 4 different beers from
Animas Brewing Company, then i want to see those 4 beers listed under Animas Brewing Company

Finally at the AR Associations and will begin model relationships

-Need to start building out controllers for Company and BeerStyle
-Need to create index(maybe delete), new and edit views for Company and BeerStyle
-Maybe seed the DB with fake data? I already have some data, not sure yet how to incorporate this
-Then I should be able to begin displaying associations

-Playing with new and edit form to check functionality of forms, both work but now have AR associations
and the errors display that both Company and Beer Style must exist
-I need to create both forms now to include those models then the forms will work properly
-Finish building CRUD actions for BeerStyles
-Build respective views (index/delete, new & edit) for models
