I want to have a bung of beer with information of each beer

Also want to CRUD with the beer
-Create (new) beer
-Read (index/show) beer
-Update (edit) beer (why would i update a beer though, thinking cap)
-Delete (destroy) beer

a Beer will belong to a Company and will belong to a BeerStyle
-so i possibly need a company and beerstyle attribute in the DB schema

A BeerStyle will have many beers
eg: stout will have Imperial Stout, Backside Stout, Draught Stout, etc
