I want to have a bunch of beer with information of each beer

Also want to CRUD with the beer
-Create (new) beer
-Read (index/show) beer
-Update (edit) beer (why would i update a beer though, thinking cap)
-Delete (destroy) beer

A Beer will belong to a Company and will belong to a BeerStyle
-so i possibly need a company and beerstyle attribute in the DB schema
eg: Colorado Kolsch will belong to Steamworks Brewing Co

A BeerStyle will have many beers
eg: stout will have Imperial Stout, Backside Stout, Draught Stout, etc

A Company will have many beers and will have many BeerStyles(don't want to worry about beerstyle yet)
eg: SteamWorks Brewing Co will have Colorado Kolsch, BackSide Stout, etc
*the company should only show the beers that you had at that company. say I've had 4 different beers from
Animas Brewing Company, then i want to see those 4 beers listed under Animas Brewing Company


091218
Finally at the AR Associations and will begin model relationships

-Need to start building out controllers for Company and BeerStyle
-Need to create index(maybe delete), new and edit views for Company and BeerStyle
-Maybe seed the DB with fake data? I already have some data, not sure yet how to incorporate this
-Then I should be able to begin displaying associations


091318
-Playing with new and edit form to check functionality of forms, both work but now have AR associations
and the errors display that both Company and Beer Style must exist
-I need to create both forms now to include those models then the forms will work properly
-Finish building CRUD actions for BeerStyles
-Build respective views (index/delete, new & edit) for models
-Add company and beerstyles to beer/new form
-Company and BeerStyle WILL NOT be created independently, they will be created with Beer initialization
-nested forms and collection_select

*this isn't on the record therefore stating: trying to create beer and company relation in console and
it's not working correctly, beer created but with nil :id, beer_style_id & company_id
company created successfully but cannot related with beer through @beer.companies << @company
company successfully displays in company index*

-is it a good idea to create Company and BeerStyle alone, without the association of Beer?
-how would i associated the models with this way?


091418
-Continue building respective views for Models
-Add Company and BeerStyle to beer/new form
-nested forms and collection_select
-right now beers/show is not displaying correct info `/companies/1` instead of `Carver Brewing Company`
-not able to create a new company or beerstyle with beer initialization, only select current


091718
-with older beers, i receive an error with beers#show regarding the link_to
-more recent beer(only 1 currently) still running into the issue where clicking on the link_to for the
company still sends me to /beers/carver brewing company (beers#show private #load_beer)
-still need to somehow build the collection_select for style and company, as in build
new instance of that class
-removed all old beer data that didn't have company or style associated, help with L60
-company url is finally fixed

-nested forms is confusing, i'm having so much trouble understanding this

-DO I NEED TO CREATE A USER MODEL FOR A USER TO GO INTO THE BEER LOG AND LOG THE BEERS THEY'VE HAD?
-why am i creating a new company form with an associated beer? is my nested form incorrect?


091818
-On a new environment(brother's laptop) starting up the application completely new
-Unable to create a new beer with a new company and beerstyle.  still need to figure out form
-Watch luisa's videos(they're super short)
-1. nest company and beer_style with fields_for in beers/new
-2. in beer model, utilize accepts_nested_attributes_for :beer_style and :company
-3. in beers con
  a. #new will possibly use .build(maybe use that in nested form instead?)
  b. #beer_params needs nesting of company and beer_style

-FINALLY:
-1. nested company form is successful
-2. can create a new beer with an associated company or create a new company upon initialization
of new beer
-3. need to now incorporate this nested association in the edit form
-4. i don't think i need a new form for company and beerstyle, just index and show
-5. need to also associate beerstyle with new beer from
-6. destroy backside stout in order to clear data and make new beer with both associations

-7. all the beer, new, nested forms, errors, collection_select, redirect and current routes are all
successful
-8. i'm trying to think of what i would utilize edit form_for/nested forms
  a. if a user accidentally gives the wrong beerstyle, they can edit that
  b. a user could possibly forget the beer style or company and needs to leave that option blank until
  they come back to edit it with the correct associations
  c. user could misspell the name of the beer, or THE FREAKING COMPANY OR BEER STYLE! i didn't think about
  and edit form for these 2 models! ah this could be a common mishap


091918
-today i need to finish implementing nested forms for beers/edit
-i also need to find a way to create beer without 1 or both company and beerstyle associations

-right now i don't want to focus so hard on logic, i know this app is beyond basic but i just
need to know all the fundamentals.  i want to build my functions, make them successfully work
then continue forward.  i can't keep lingering on all the more complex scenarios for an edit form
or blank fields
-also with the edit form, i somehow(don't recall when) created a function for the field to be
filled already with the attributes and associations. with the associations of beerstyle and company
if that field is filled with the info it will then create a new company and beerstyle.  almost like
a duplicate and i don't want that, therefore i removed the the option of the create field for edit

-Moving onto bigger and better things like partials and auth and sessions etc.


092618
-I'm back and I'm going to work on display has many through and watch 2 videos
-I got this, I have missed coding for the past week!


092718
-working on has many through today and trying to move onto the 2 videos i wanted to watch and finish
yesterday
-beer show page needs to also include beer style alongside company
-beer style show is correct and links work BUT... running into issue of exact dupe of company


092818
-continue with 2 videos
  1. has many through in forms
  2. deep dive into nested forms


100118
-is has_many through in forms useful for me?
-first:  my beerstyle model and company model both have a reciprocating association, currently in my
beerstyle show page i can see the company that has the beerstyle(that i have tried).  my company show page
displays on the beers of that company.  i could also display the beerstyles associated with that company,
if i wanted to
-second: has many through in forms, is this abstraction needed?  i already have implemented the option of
selecting an existing instance or creating a new instance.  from the lesson, it seems that i'm just
building this implementation a different way, that i just haven't understood
-third: i don't understand the part in has many though in forms where i would create a join table and model
of beer_style_companies. this part of the join table is a bit confusing to me
-since i'm already able to display relationships with models do i need to use an abstraction of has many
through in forms with _ids= and join tables of beer_style_companies? i'm overwhelmed with this and
want to move on but i know i should try to understand the purpose of this

-does beer style need to have a destroy, edit, update, new even?
-company has REST but is that necessary?  do i care to modify or delete either models?
-company also has new while beer style doesn't.  not sure how this works, both models are instantiated
with new beer.
-maybe just test company actions to see what is necessary, try making code DRY with company company con


100218
-Work on Layout and Partials section
-do i have nested forms? i only have two forms:new and edit. neither of these are nested, they're very one
layer
-i guess the only nesting i have is when a beer is created with beerstyle and company "nested" in the form
-well i have the nested form BUT... am i nesting it in the form?

-okay so i do have nested form laid out correctly in my application

-working on layouts for beer log application
-figuring out if i want to use application con or beers con for layout files
-also working on partials
(this is what i wanted to really get into today!!! :D )
-HOME button should go to home and maybe i should have a BEERS button but the beer index is basically the
home of the application

-create Partials for beers/new and beers/edit where i can
-both have very similar forms: error_explanations, field_with_errors, label and formbuilder
-OKAY WAIT, how do i do this with the collection_select?
  1. my new form has a select & create new company and/or beer style
  2. edit form only has collection_select
  3. how do i remove the repeated code? both have very similar relationship options
  4. will this work with a formbuilder? i'm creating it in the _form and calling the f.whatever in new/edit
  5. maybe i can create a separate formbuilder for the collection_select part of new and edit
  6. i have to figure out a way to make partial including collection_select options AND the creation of
     new company and beer style!!!!!!


100918
-I'm not certain what I'm doing today but I'm just going to create as many new parts of my app
-Once I have a more detailed idea of what I want to accomplish then I will include that here
-I want to really work on this project today, coding is calling my name, calling me to be present

-Eventually figure out the partial for new/edit forms to allow submit button to be on it's own, i don't
 know how to do this yet

-working on routing nested resources, nothing has changed in the URL, i may need to actually implement
 actions that are suggested
-my associations and displays are already working in the way the nested routes are suggesting
-the thing is i actually don't have nested routes, i just have the behavior
-this is the URL result, no bueno: http://localhost:3000/beers?utf8=%E2%9C%93&beer_style=3&commit=Filter
-also now beerstyle filter works BUT the beerstyle show page is not working
-okay, i needed beerstyles#show(DUH), i still don't have nested routes though
-now trying to utilize nested resource BUT my beers/index is not working!!!
-corrected beers resource

-asking about Helpers and the purpose of when to and why use them


101118
-nested routes still aren't present, i just have normal routes
-i think what's happening is that i nested Beer resource under BeerStyle but in my beerstyle views
 i'm displaying the link to the associated company not beer
-maybe i need to rearrange my filter, views and my nested resource to match that of my associations

-currently Company displays both beer and beer styles associated
-maybe i could try to nest a model under Company and see what happens

-i feel like i just made kind of a mess with all this nesting because i didn't begin following the proper
 model relationships from the beginning
-should i just nest beerstyle and beer under company? because company has_many of both models
-makes sense(to me) to display both models under a company(as i did in the company show view)
-may need to really rework nesting from the beginning and correctly
-technically only beerstyle#index has been modified for filter function
 1. fix beerstyle filter(or maybe keep it because it's a good feature)
 2. beer should be nested under company
 3. beerstyle should be nested under company
 4. would i rework the Company Con in order for nested resource routes to work? currently some of it works
 5. fix companies/:id/beer_styles/:id beerstyle#show
 6. how do i fix /beer_styles/:id (this is terrible)
 7. how do i fix this---> http://localhost:3000/beers?utf8=%E2%9C%93&beer_style=2&commit=Filter (horrible)


101518
-i need to actually correct the order with nesting resources because as stated before, i didn't begin
 following proper model relationships to begin with
-also running into same issues with BeerStyles#show
-need to catch up with all the things to work out from above(101118)
-currently beerstyle id is not working in browser.
 1. AR::RecordNotFound in BeerStylesController#show AND Couldn't find BeerStyle without an ID
 2. http://localhost:3000/beer_styles.4
 3. link_to is <a href="/beer_styles.4">Pilsner</a> (which i don't know how the .4(.id) got here)


 101618
 -i'm thinking i'll just nest beerstyle and beer under company
 -maybe also nest beer under beerstyle???
 -i can nest whatever model as long as it makes sense to nest that way
 -i still need to fix the odd dynamic filter route
 -create company nesting actions for beer and beerstyles both
 -reach out to instructor for horrible filter URL
 -then FREAKING MOVE ON


101718
-right now work on company nesting actions
 see how that turns out
-currently unable to next beer and beerstyle routes, not sure why though
-able to get nested routes present and correct but now i'm running into a beers#show error that i thought
 would be a simple fix, it's not!!!

-Filter Function
  1. try to re-implement the function
  2. i need to make sure that the company actions for both the beers and beerstyles are correct
  3. maybe not nest beer under beerstyle but not sure how to cater the beers#index to the the filter func
  4. beers#index previously have the correct func set up for filter, maybe go back to that

-for the nested routes under companies, i'm going to only use show for both beer and beerstyle since i'm
 already indexing those models in the company show page

-currently both the beer and beer_style nested routes work correctly
-some odd things that i don't understand how it's working but works
  1. i don't need direct companies#action for nested beerstyle, it works just being a nested resources
  2. BUT nested beers resources DOES need direct companies#action or else the id= error arises
 ***i now know why the id= error was occurring, beer id was calling beers#show.  but because beer is also
 nested under both Company and BeerStyle, i needed to direct beer to that specific action in order to
 correctly call and display the beer show as a nested resources. it's all making sense. this makes so much
 sense now***

-Next to work on
  1. nest beer under beer_style
  2. just need the beer/show
  3. also add beer to beerstyle show page since i want nested route of '/beer_styles/:id/beer/:id'
  4. DO NOT FORGET TO DIRECT NESTED BEERS UNDER BEERSTYLES RESOURCES

-Now let's try to incorporate the filter function
  1. beers#index plays a role here
  2. re-incorporate the filter form
  3. do i need to create another action for beer index of beer_style
  4. do i also need to direct that resource to an action
  *I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THE TERRIBLE URL ISSUE EVEN AFTER RESEARCHING WAYS AND FOLLOWING EXACT
  LESSON STEPS.  i need to move on now!!!*


101818
BE A MACHINE TODAY
-Working currently on modifying nested routes
 eg: creating new Beer nested under Company
 *do i want to do this though? i already created Beer to associate with Company and BeerStyle. if i create
 a Beer under Company then it will most likely not have an associated BeerStyle. which then i'd have to go
 to the edit form and include that. but my current validations include attrs of BeerStyle and Company. i
 may play with this but i really don't like the idea.*

-OMG i successfully created a new beer nested under the company AND i was able to associated a style!!!
-Answered my own question to resolve a possible issue!!!

-Just realized that my 'Create New Beer Style' text_field is gone, Haven't noticed this in a while
-^^^Fixed this with altering the beers#new but keep running into a beers#show issue with the nested routes

-Finally fixed the filter URL issue, mostly.  95% fixed. the URL needs to be manually written
-Filter button isn't able to find the beerstyle id to inject in the url /beer_styles/:id/beers
-I can modify this with an event handler in javascript


101918
-Machine again even if there are a few other things going on. Still be here when I can be here and give it
 my all
-tested the edit beer nested under company and that is working correctly


102218
-when using filter function in the index page, the error is:
  1. ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound in BeerStylesController#beer_index
  2. Couldn't find BeerStyle with 'id'=:id
  *this is due to the part where you can only manually write out the URL with the correct :id.  this isn't
  working with the actual filter submit.  JS handlers will help this*


102518
-currently i don't have auth because i don't have users. not sure how to implement this
-right now my application is solely used by me, as if i'm the only one with the profile and access to it
-it's meant to be a log(journal entry) of beers tried
-i may implement user auth&auth in the next layer, not sure though


102918
-going to see if i can implement the sessions controller with a login and logout function
[x]generate sessions controller
[x]#new AND #create
[x]map GET and POST /login
[]#destroy to handle logging out (technically destroying a session)
  -running into a routing error with /logout, nit sure why or what to do
  -created a logout link in home view but that won't go anywhere
  -looking at past lab and it's not helpful so far, only one file had been changed
  -looked in other views/controllers, unable to figure out how to work this, i don't even know where the
   'logout' button/link is created in the lab
[x]maybe create link_to on homepage to LOGIN ---> login page ---> beers index page

-i don't know what 'protect_from_forgery prepend:' is, will come back after researching it


103018
-figure out logout issue but don't spend too much time on it
-11 lessons/labs today, I can do this
-Video review will take the longest but that's okay, do it with pomodoro
-legitimately i don't want to have logout on the home page alongside the login form(later implement the
 logic for this.)

-my before_action isn't really working, i'm able to go to /beers and many other URLs and see content

-i got the logout button to disappear in the root page but it will not show once a user is logged in
-do i need to use link_to instead of form?

-current_user is nil, not sure why
-sessions doesn't seem to capture the username and use it for the conditional purpose

-new link on beers index works
-none of the beer show links work, get directed to login page!!!
(well because my beer controller has the :require_login before_action setup)
-BUT i am logged in at this point, in order to get to the beers index, i need to log in then i should be
 able to maneuver the app
L367: THAT WAS THE REASON, upon removal, you can still access beers show
-BUT if the user is logged in then they should still be able to access all the app
FRUSTRATING


110118
-may be able to finish auth with authentication review video
-it's simpler and involves a User model which is more ideal
-in video, there aren't associations yet with user and other established models
-basic login, signup, logout set up
-create auth branch, merge if the feature works properly, delete branch if i don't like it
-auth will become more complex but first create basic foundation to understand how it works
-in future branches i may completely change user feature
*react/redux project doesn't require user login but i am creating this app and would possibly like to
allow for user account and login.  could i use a rails auth setup with react/redux?*


110218
-field_with_errors is not specified in the views but will still work on app
-maybe refactor a lot of my views in order to remove hardcode field_with_errors?
-currently when a beer is created without a field then the error message shows up and i like that part

-practice auth&auth with video, not alongside lesson but alongside video
-video helps explain user creation, login, logout and access to application without any association
-need to figure out how to go back to the version of 102518(version before auth implementation)
