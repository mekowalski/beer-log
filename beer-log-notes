I want to have a bunch of beer with information of each beer

Also want to CRUD with the beer
-Create (new) beer
-Read (index/show) beer
-Update (edit) beer (why would i update a beer though, thinking cap)
-Delete (destroy) beer

A Beer will belong to a Company and will belong to a BeerStyle
-so i possibly need a company and beerstyle attribute in the DB schema
eg: Colorado Kolsch will belong to Steamworks Brewing Co

A BeerStyle will have many beers
eg: stout will have Imperial Stout, Backside Stout, Draught Stout, etc

A Company will have many beers and will have many BeerStyles(don't want to worry about beerstyle yet)
eg: SteamWorks Brewing Co will have Colorado Kolsch, BackSide Stout, etc
*the company should only show the beers that you had at that company. say I've had 4 different beers from
Animas Brewing Company, then i want to see those 4 beers listed under Animas Brewing Company

Finally at the AR Associations and will begin model relationships

-Need to start building out controllers for Company and BeerStyle
-Need to create index(maybe delete), new and edit views for Company and BeerStyle
-Maybe seed the DB with fake data? I already have some data, not sure yet how to incorporate this
-Then I should be able to begin displaying associations

-Playing with new and edit form to check functionality of forms, both work but now have AR associations
and the errors display that both Company and Beer Style must exist
-I need to create both forms now to include those models then the forms will work properly
-Finish building CRUD actions for BeerStyles
-Build respective views (index/delete, new & edit) for models
-Add company and beerstyles to beer/new form
-Company and BeerStyle WILL NOT be created independently, they will be created with Beer initialization
-nested forms and collection_select

*this isn't on the record therefore stating: trying to create beer and company relation in console and
it's not working correctly, beer created but with nil :id, beer_style_id & company_id
company created successfully but cannot related with beer through @beer.companies << @company
company successfully displays in company index*

-is it a good idea to create Company and BeerStyle alone, without the association of Beer?
-how would i associated the models with this way?


091418
-Continue building respective views for Models
-Add Company and BeerStyle to beer/new form
-nested forms and collection_select
-right now beers/show is not displaying correct info `/companies/1` instead of `Carver Brewing Company`
-not able to create a new company or beerstyle with beer initialization, only select current

-with older beers, i receive an error with beers#show regarding the link_to
-more recent beer(only 1 currently) still running into the issue where clicking on the link_to for the
company still sends me to /beers/carver brewing company (beers#show private #load_beer)
-still need to somehow build the collection_select for style and company, as in build
new instance of that class
-removed all old beer data that didn't have company or style associated, help with L60
-company url is finally fixed

-nested forms is confusing, i'm having so much trouble understanding this

-DO I NEED TO CREATE A USER MODEL FOR A USER TO GO INTO THE BEER LOG AND LOG THE BEERS THEY'VE HAD?
-why am i creating a new company form with an associated beer? is my nested form incorrect?


091818
-On a new environment(brother's laptop) starting up the application completely new
-Unable to create a new beer with a new company and beerstyle.  still need to figure out form
-Watch luisa's videos(they're super short)
-1. nest company and beer_style with fields_for in beers/new
-2. in beer model, utilize accepts_nested_attributes_for :beer_style and :company
-3. in beers con
  a. #new will possibly use .build(maybe use that in nested form instead?)
  b. #beer_params needs nesting of compnay and beer_style

-FINALLY:
-1. nested company form is successful
-2. can create a new beer with an associated company or create a new company upon initialization
of new beer
-3. need to now incorporate this nested association in the edit form
-4. i don't think i need a new form for company and beerstyle, just index and show
-5. need to also associate beeerstyle with new beer from
-6. destroy backside stout in order to clear data and make new beer with both associations
