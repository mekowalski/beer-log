I want to have a bunch of beer with information of each beer

Also want to CRUD with the beer
-Create (new) beer
-Read (index/show) beer
-Update (edit) beer (why would i update a beer though, thinking cap)
-Delete (destroy) beer

A Beer will belong to a Company and will belong to a BeerStyle
-so i possibly need a company and beerstyle attribute in the DB schema
eg: Colorado Kolsch will belong to Steamworks Brewing Co

A BeerStyle will have many beers
eg: stout will have Imperial Stout, Backside Stout, Draught Stout, etc

A Company will have many beers and will have many BeerStyles(don't want to worry about beerstyle yet)
eg: SteamWorks Brewing Co will have Colorado Kolsch, BackSide Stout, etc
*the company should only show the beers that you had at that company. say I've had 4 different beers from
Animas Brewing Company, then i want to see those 4 beers listed under Animas Brewing Company

Finally at the AR Associations and will begin model relationships

-Need to start building out controllers for Company and BeerStyle
-Need to create index(maybe delete), new and edit views for Company and BeerStyle
-Maybe seed the DB with fake data? I already have some data, not sure yet how to incorporate this
-Then I should be able to begin displaying associations


091318
-Playing with new and edit form to check functionality of forms, both work but now have AR associations
and the errors display that both Company and Beer Style must exist
-I need to create both forms now to include those models then the forms will work properly
-Finish building CRUD actions for BeerStyles
-Build respective views (index/delete, new & edit) for models
-Add company and beerstyles to beer/new form
-Company and BeerStyle WILL NOT be created independently, they will be created with Beer initialization
-nested forms and collection_select

*this isn't on the record therefore stating: trying to create beer and company relation in console and
it's not working correctly, beer created but with nil :id, beer_style_id & company_id
company created successfully but cannot related with beer through @beer.companies << @company
company successfully displays in company index*

-is it a good idea to create Company and BeerStyle alone, without the association of Beer?
-how would i associated the models with this way?


091418
-Continue building respective views for Models
-Add Company and BeerStyle to beer/new form
-nested forms and collection_select
-right now beers/show is not displaying correct info `/companies/1` instead of `Carver Brewing Company`
-not able to create a new company or beerstyle with beer initialization, only select current


091718
-with older beers, i receive an error with beers#show regarding the link_to
-more recent beer(only 1 currently) still running into the issue where clicking on the link_to for the
company still sends me to /beers/carver brewing company (beers#show private #load_beer)
-still need to somehow build the collection_select for style and company, as in build
new instance of that class
-removed all old beer data that didn't have company or style associated, help with L60
-company url is finally fixed

-nested forms is confusing, i'm having so much trouble understanding this

-DO I NEED TO CREATE A USER MODEL FOR A USER TO GO INTO THE BEER LOG AND LOG THE BEERS THEY'VE HAD?
-why am i creating a new company form with an associated beer? is my nested form incorrect?


091818
-On a new environment(brother's laptop) starting up the application completely new
-Unable to create a new beer with a new company and beerstyle.  still need to figure out form
-Watch luisa's videos(they're super short)
-1. nest company and beer_style with fields_for in beers/new
-2. in beer model, utilize accepts_nested_attributes_for :beer_style and :company
-3. in beers con
  a. #new will possibly use .build(maybe use that in nested form instead?)
  b. #beer_params needs nesting of company and beer_style

-FINALLY:
-1. nested company form is successful
-2. can create a new beer with an associated company or create a new company upon initialization
of new beer
-3. need to now incorporate this nested association in the edit form
-4. i don't think i need a new form for company and beerstyle, just index and show
-5. need to also associate beerstyle with new beer from
-6. destroy backside stout in order to clear data and make new beer with both associations

-7. all the beer, new, nested forms, errors, collection_select, redirect and current routes are all
successful
-8. i'm trying to think of what i would utilize edit form_for/nested forms
  a. if a user accidentally gives the wrong beerstyle, they can edit that
  b. a user could possibly forget the beer style or company and needs to leave that option blank until
  they come back to edit it with the correct associations
  c. user could misspell the name of the beer, or THE FREAKING COMPANY OR BEER STYLE! i didn't think about
  and edit form for these 2 models! ah this could be a common mishap


091918
-today i need to finish implementing nested forms for beers/edit
-i also need to find a way to create beer without 1 or both company and beerstyle associations

-right now i don't want to focus so hard on logic, i know this app is beyond basic but i just
need to know all the fundamentals.  i want to build my functions, make them successfully work
then continue forward.  i can't keep lingering on all the more complex scenarios for an edit form
or blank fields
-also with the edit form, i somehow(don't recall when) created a function for the field to be
filled already with the attributes and associations. with the associations of beerstyle and company
if that field is filled with the info it will then create a new company and beerstyle.  almost like
a duplicate and i don't want that, therefore i removed the the option of the create field for edit

-Moving onto bigger and better things like partials and auth and sessions etc.

-I'm back and I'm going to work on display has many through and watch 2 videos
-I got this, I have missed coding for the past week!


092718
-working on has many through today and trying to move onto the 2 videos i wanted to watch and finish
yesterday
-beer show page needs to also include beer style alongside company
-beer style show is correct and links work BUT... running into issue of exact dupe of company


092818
-continue with 2 videos
  1. has many through in forms
  2. deep dive into nested forms

-is has_many through in forms useful for me?
-first:  my beerstyle model and company model both have a reciprocating association, currently in my
beerstyle show page i can see the company that has the beerstyle(that i have tried).  my company show page
displays on the beers of that company.  i could also display the beerstyles associated with that company,
if i wanted to
-second: has many through in forms, is this abstraction needed?  i already have implemented the option of
selecting an existing instance or creating a new instance.  from the lesson, it seems that i'm just
building this implementation a different way, that i just haven't understood
-third: i don't understand the part in has many though in forms where i would create a join table and model
of beer_style_companies. this part of the join table is a bit confusing to me
-since i'm already able to display relationships with models do i need to use an abstraction of has many
through in forms with _ids= and join tables of beer_style_companies? i'm overwhelmed with this and
want to move on but i know i should try to understand the purpose of this

-does beer style need to have a destroy, edit, update, new even?
-company has REST but is that necessary?  do i care to modify or delete either models?
-company also has new while beer style doesn't.  not sure how this works, both models are instantiated
with new beer.
-maybe just test company actions to see what is necessary, try making code DRY with company company con

-Work on Layout and Partials section
-do i have nested forms? i only have two forms:new and edit. neither of these are nested, they're very one
layer
-i guess the only nesting i have is when a beer is created with beerstyle and company "nested" in the form
-well i have the nested form BUT... am i nesting it in the form?

-okay so i do have nested form laid out correctly in my application

-working on layouts for beer log application
-figuring out if i want to use application con or beers con for layout files
-also working on partials
(this is what i wanted to really get into today!!! :D )
-HOME button should go to home and maybe i should have a BEERS button but the beer index is basically the
home of the application

-create Partials for beers/new and beers/edit where i can
-both have very similar forms: error_explanations, field_with_errors, label and formbuilder
-OKAY WAIT, how do i do this with the collection_select?
  1. my new form has a select & create new company and/or beer style
  2. edit form only has collection_select
  3. how do i remove the repeated code? both have very similar relationship options
  4. will this work with a formbuilder? i'm creating it in the _form and calling the f.whatever in new/edit
  5. maybe i can create a separate formbuilder for the collection_select part of new and edit
  6. i have to figure out a way to make partial including collection_select options AND the creation of
     new company and beer style!!!!!!


100918
-I'm not certain what I'm doing today but I'm just going to create as many new parts of my app
-Once I have a more detailed idea of what I want to accomplish then I will include that here
-I want to really work on this project today, coding is calling my name, calling me to be present

-Eventually figure out the partial for new/edit forms to allow submit button to be on it's own, i don't
 know how to do this yet

-working on routing nested resources, nothing has changed in the URL, i may need to actually implement
 actions that are suggested
-my associations and displays are already working in the way the nested routes are suggesting
-the thing is i actually don't have nested routes, i just have the behavior
-this is the URL result, no bueno: http://localhost:3000/beers?utf8=%E2%9C%93&beer_style=3&commit=Filter
-also now beerstyle filter works BUT the beerstyle show page is not working
-okay, i needed beerstyles#show(DUH), i still don't have nested routes though
-now trying to utilize nested resource BUT my beers/index is not working!!!
